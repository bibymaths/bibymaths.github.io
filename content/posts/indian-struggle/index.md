The bittersweet feeling of 15th August 1947 is imbibed in my bone and flesh, reinforced throughout attending army
school, validated after meeting people who truly believe the world has moved on and it’s a new age.

When the British empire was aware that losing its biggest colony is inevitable, the end of the British mandate on another part
of the world was near.

We had 75 years to build our country from the ruins of Persian-Turkic invasions, British Colonialism, Portuguese,
German, French, and Spanish intervention for territorial, religious, and economic interests within them.

We built our nation by our own hands, sweat and blood unlike many in the west which had taken help with the backs of
migrant workers for centuries.

Two years prior to India’s independence from the British empire, along with the end of 20th century rhetoric, a lot of gears
set in motion as a result from the historical habit of Europe: North Atlantic security concerns, creation of United Nations,
and a British promise to the Zionists. When Ahad Isan lost support of Russian oligarchy, Ben Gurion’s implementable
version of Zionism became dominant. Zionist movement gained traction and trajectory over a period of 300 years. At one
point, Nazism and Zionism cooperated for mutual consequential interests. In the process of making Judeo-Christian Europe
to a Christian Europe, justified reasons became feelings for that promise.

When the freedom fighters of India bombed, rioted, protested, and fought against the British regime: military and
government, they received the label of terrorists. Were they?

At the time, the world saw the demise of a fascist dictatorship at the heart of Europe, and neutered Germany never been
united again.

Apparently, leaders of the free world always managed to fund military dictatorship, whether it’s west of India, or west
of Russia, or west of Jordan. We see a pattern here, no matter how bowdlerized they presented themselves.

There was a light in the dark ages, and it was blinding for the greedy. Ungratefulness is a gift for the proclamation of
Adler’s complex theory. It wasn’t complex unlike the admired Eurocentric view of the late puritans.

However, Tantura is more than a movie as much as the bloody history of the world. It is still written intentionally to
eject some people, groups, and religions.

If it was so easy to convert a mosque to church after 800 years of being, it is surely easier to make a diverse place to
ethnocentric hub. The legal divorce isn’t really legal if we go back, but the unholy unions seem to have been blessed
with lead, and iron.

Emancipation by Churchill induced famine and starvation in the easternmost state of Bengal wouldn’t be possible if it
wasn’t for the allied powers to put pressure on the axis. Money comes, and Money goes, but corpses remain underneath.
