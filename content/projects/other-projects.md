### 1. Early Work & Snippets  

A collection of small Perl scripts for bioinformatics and algorithmic practice, covering sequence analysis, string manipulation, alignment, motif search, and classic problems (e.g., Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi).

Not a standalone research project, but an early codebase that reflects foundational scripting and problem-solving.
