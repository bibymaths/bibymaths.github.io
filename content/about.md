Hi, I’m Abhinav Mishra — a bioinformatics researcher motivated by mathematics and programming to tackle complex
biological questions. With strong foundations in computational biology, statistical modeling, and algorithm design, I
specialize in optimization and network-based analysis in cancer and systems medicine.

My research combines machine learning, pharmacokinetics, and systems biology, bridging gaps between data science and
biomedical discovery.
