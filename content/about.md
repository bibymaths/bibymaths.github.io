I’m a bioinformatician motivated by mathematics and programming to transform biological complexity into computationally tractable problems. My research spans optimization, network-based analysis, and pharmacokinetics, with a focus on cancer systems biology.

I specialize in integrating multi-omics data and building optimization-driven models that link molecular networks to drug responses. To make this work scalable and reproducible, I develop open-source pipelines using HPC, containerization, and workflow systems.

Beyond research, I actively engage in open science and mentoring through the BioBaes community, contributing to a collaborative ecosystem for bioinformatics enthusiasts. Looking ahead, I aim to expand these methods toward precision medicine, where predictive models can guide real-world clinical decisions.
