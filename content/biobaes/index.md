[BioBaes](https://www.linkedin.com/company/biobaes/about) was started in 2020 by [Pawan Verma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawan-verma-engineering/) as a community-driven initiative for bioinformatics and life science enthusiasts. It aimed to bring together students, researchers, and professionals to share knowledge, resources, and ideas at the intersection of biology and data.

Although it has been dormant for nearly two years, I plan to revive BioBaes in 2025 with fresh energy, updated content, and a renewed focus on collaboration and open science.
